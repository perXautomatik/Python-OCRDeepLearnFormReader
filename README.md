# Python-OCRDeepLearnFormReader

attempt to make a dynamically learning OCR solution for field recognition and parsing

Todo: basic interface, identified fields, and rest of image

fields replacing area with identified text on white background intractable  field resulting pop-up upup or focus to image covered and texint erpreteded

text is eather grey -> generated, or black -> corrected

corrected fields i feedback to thOCRcr algorithm, teatching it for further parsing,

every field corrected is store referencece 

* every field, black or grey text, is represented as a json file, where 1 row, is 1 set of text.
export should be possible

each file should be parsed one at a tresultssult can be viewed acknowledged

simple queue import by directing to file structure

later database integration is required for (correction, only if relevant) of certain fields and 

batch processing is later relevant

on exit, stores thought algorithm for next upload

automatic parsing and database update.

technical comment regarding openCV;
rotary blocks will not be necessary
--padding variable might be changeable for each field
